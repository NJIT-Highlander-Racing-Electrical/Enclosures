# Enclosures

A repository dedicated to the research and design of electrical enclosures

## Features

There are many features/goals that make a good enclosure: 

* Waterproofing - Enclosures should be able to handle splashes from water, mud, and more
* Heat Resistance - Enclosures should be able to handle exposure to direct sunlight and high temperatures
* Durability - Enclosures should be able to handle vibrations and other impacts from driving
* Acessibility - Enclosures should be able to be opened to access the electronics inside

## Connections

* Most enclosures will have some kind of connections between the hardware inside and the rest of the vehicle
* The main connections will mainly be made with [aviation plug connectors](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61v8dHQIpRL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg)
* Ideally any other wires not going through the aviation plug connectors will be waterproofed using [cable glands](https://www.metalcablegland.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cable-glands-on-waterproof-enclosure.jpg)
* To keep any removable covers waterproof, [o-ring material](https://www.mcmaster.com/12975K32) can be used
